Overview
================
BOB is a SAT-based tool for constructing optimal linear layouts of graphs. With a modern SAT solver, it is capable to compute optimal stack, queue, or track layouts of graphs with hundreds of vertices within several minutes.

Visit https://spupyrev.github.io/linearlayouts.html for a survey of existing results regarding upper and lower bounds on stack number, queue number and track number of various classes of graphs. If you use BOB in your research, please cite it as follows:

Basic Setup
--------

1. Compile the library by running:

        make

2. Run the tool:

        bob -i=graphs/graph.dot -o=graph.dimacs -stacks=3

    The tool accepts graphs in the [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) and [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language) formats. The output is the [DIMACS](http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html) format.
For the list of supported options use:

        bob -help
	
3. Download and setup a SAT solver such as [Lingeling](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling) or [Glucose](http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose) 

4. Use the SAT solver to test embeddability of the graph:

        treengeling graph.dimacs > result.dimacs

5. Print the resulting layout:

        bob -i=graphs/graph.dot -result=result.dimacs -stacks=3

Examples
--------

Test whether an input graph can be embedded in 2 [stacks](https://spupyrev.github.io/linearlayouts.html#stack)

        bob -i=graphs/graph.dot -o=graph.dimacs -stacks=2


Test whether an input graph can be embedded in 2 [queues](https://spupyrev.github.io/linearlayouts.html#queue)

        bob -i=graphs/graph.dot -o=graph.dimacs -queues=2

Test whether an input graph admits a [6-track layout](https://spupyrev.github.io/linearlayouts.html#track) and print resulting layout

        bob -i=graphs/weakly_6tracks.gml -o=graph.dimacs -tracks=6
        treengeling graph.dimacs > result.dimacs
        bob -i=graphs/weakly_6tracks.gml -result=result.dimacs -tracks=6
